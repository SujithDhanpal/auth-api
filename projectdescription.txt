4. http://127.0.0.1:8000/oauth/home/ : This is allowed only for the restricted users.(A GET request)

you can use postman to test the apis


Database:
 In database I have a Table by name authapp_user. you can find it in (Servers/PostgreSQL/DataBases/myapi/Schemas/public/Tables/authapp_user).It has the following fields.
    a. Username
    a. First name
    b. Last name
    d. Email
    e. Password

I was asked to add id but instead used Username because I felt it is easy to remember username rather than id.


I used email and password to authenticate users as described in the problem statement. 
Password is not stored as plain text but as an encripted text.
